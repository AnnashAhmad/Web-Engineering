    - ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN DEPARTMENT
 </pre>
 <p>
     The decision to start a Department of Architecture at Islamabad is an opportunity to set a new course for Architecture in Pakistan. It is an opportunity to re-examine and re-value the architectural education prevalent in the country. This is also an effort to bring back Art into Architecture which was lost in the last few centuries. The aim is to create holistic thinking about the conceptual basis of design.
     Architecture must flow from the mind of the architect always addressing the issues of tradition, function, energy efficiency, climate control, structural stability and any other factor that impinges concepts of the solutions to the problem.
